#Rock-Paper-Scissors Game: In this game, your bot will prompt the player to choose either rock, paper, or scissors. The bot will then randomly choose one of the options as well. The game will continue until the player decides to quit or until a predetermined number of rounds has been played. The player with the most wins at the end of the game is declared the winner.
